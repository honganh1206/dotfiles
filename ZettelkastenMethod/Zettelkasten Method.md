# Zettelkasten method

> [!tip]
> 
> Writing happens DURING research.

## Simplification

- One note = one idea/thought

## External memory

- Learn to **trust the system**: Easily navigate through the notes

“I only do what is easy. I only write when I immediately know how to do it. If I falter for a moment, I put the matter aside and do something else.” 
-- Niklas Luhmann


## How to take notes

- Sometimes our minds can deceive us by making us think that the task at hand is easier than we initially thought
- Notes should be **thought-provoking** and **utilize all sources**
- Be aware of the **uniqueness** and **originality** of the information at hand 
- Do not collect information but **gather knowledge**
- Controversial: Do not highlight things => **Read with a pen** and **summarize** them
- We link our notes!

### Fleeting notes
`
- Steps: Capture (what you think are interesting) → Fleeting notes → Process
- **No pain no gain**: What is challenging is worth completing

“f you can’t say it clearly, you don’t understand it yourself” 
-- John Searle

- Fleeting notes should be: Short-lived + Brief + Of quick capture
- We should gather the notes in one place without distraction, after then we can do regular processing

### Permanent notes

- Permanent notes should be: Articulated + Written in your own words + Solidified
- What to do with permanent notes:
	- One idea per card
	- Do not copy
	- Brief and concise
	- Write just like you are trying to publish it


## Note-taking lifestyle

### Inputs and Outputs

- Inputs can come from everywhere e.g., conversations, blogs, articles, videos
- Notes are blueprints for outputs

> [!info]
> 
> An average person consumes 34gb of information daily.

- Capture what is worth capturing with **input filtering**
- For inputs - Ensure what you watch:
	- Aligned with your goals
	- 80% intentional / 20% relaxed
	- Scheduled

### Consumption Backlog

> [!tip]
> 
> On Obsidian, make tags e.g., #consume for notes

### Intentionality

- Make every opportunity of gathering knowledge **counts**
- Be attentive of **writing about everything** (might need to bring your notebooks with you everywhere)

## Zettelkasten in Obsidian

### Setup

1. New vault > 5 folders: Inbox (for new notes), Journal (for daily notes), Zettelkasten, Input and Output
2. Settings > Files and Links > Default location for new notes to Inbox (Personally I do not prefer this)
3. Settings > Daily notes > New file location as Journal > Open daily notes on startup

### Personal setup

- Unique notes will go to `04-Permanent/UniqueNotes`
- Daily notes will go to `06-Daily-Weekly/Daily`
- New notes created on the fly will go to `05-Fleeting`

### Creating a new note

- Create a new untitled note in the destined folder > Choose `Insert Template` on the left sidebar > Choose the `Study` template


> [!tip] Tips
> - Create notes from **other notes**.
> - Use a canvas to link your notes


## Tags vs. Folders


> [!tip]
> Tags are to unite notes, while folders are to separate notes.



> [!warning] 
> Note-taking should NOT be a time-sink.
