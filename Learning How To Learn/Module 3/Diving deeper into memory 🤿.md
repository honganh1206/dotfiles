To learn better, we need to combine both of our **spatial** and **visual** memories.

For visual memory, we can use **memorable visual images** to represent key items. For example, when learning Newton’s second law $F=m.a$, we can imagine the $F$ as flying, $m$ as a mule and $a$ as ass => *A mule flying with his ass*.


> [!info] Images and memory
> Images can connect **directly** to our right brain’s visual spatial centers. This can help us tap into the visual areas with *enhanced memory abilities*.
