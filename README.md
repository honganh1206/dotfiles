# What for?

- Sync Obsidian settings (Plugins, Configs, etc.) between vaults MANUALLY
- Store `settings.json` and `keybindings.json` configs for VS Code (to sync with laptops I cannot log in with my personal Microsoft account)
- Also to store useful links + templates

# How?

- Copy the `obsidian-vault-settings` folder to the **root** folder of a vault
- Rename it to `.obsidian` and override the current `.obsidian` folder if needed
