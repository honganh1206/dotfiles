Einstellung is a **pattern** in which what you have developed might **prevent** another solution from being found.


> [!info] Pinball machine metaphor
> Imagine there is a **pinball machine**: When we shoot the ball, the ball might only collide within a specific area, but the solution can only be found in the area that does not have frequent collisions.

For this reason, sometimes you have to **unlearn** what is erroneous while learning new ones.
