1. Prepare a list of key tasks right before going to bed: The tasks should be **process-oriented** a.k.a not too big so you can focus on other tasks.
2. Planning a quitting time: The quitting time is **as important as** the beginning time.
3. Eat the frog: Try to finish 1 unpleasant task first in the morning.
4. Reward yourself :) Donâ€™t be too harsh on yourself sometimes.
