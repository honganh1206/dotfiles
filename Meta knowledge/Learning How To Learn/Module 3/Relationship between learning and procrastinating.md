Learning is bit by bit and it might sound unpleasant, and procrastination happens *when we feel uncomfortable at the thought of doing something we do not like*. Instead, we turn to doing something pleasant as it makes us feel better **but only temporarily**.

In a sense, **procrastination is similar to addiction**: Both give **temporary** excitement and relief from the boring reality.
