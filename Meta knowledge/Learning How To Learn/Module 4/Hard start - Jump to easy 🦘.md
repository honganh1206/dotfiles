Solving easy problems before moving on to hard ones seems like a common approach, but it is actually **counter-intuitive**!

> Start with the hard problems, then jump to the easy ones.

Really: Spend 1-2 minutes wrestling with the hardest problem (Focused mode), then move to the easy ones even if you cannot solve the hardest one (Diffuse mode). Complete as much easy problems as you can then move to the hard ones.

Doing this will help you **warm up your diffuse mode** to have a big-picture perspective of the test.
